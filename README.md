## Problem Statement

Bruce Wayne is tired of constantly having to look out of the window every 10 min to see if there’s a bat sign,
and he would like to leverage technology to make his life easier. He can’t simply hand out his cell phone
number as that can be traced, so he’s come to us to build a web app with a panic button which he can give
to Commissioner Gordon.
